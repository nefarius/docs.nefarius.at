# About Controller Compatibility

!!! important "TL;DR"
    If your controller works, great. If it does not, we cannot guarantee support for every third-party device.

This set of drivers has been designed for and tested with the original Sony PlayStation **3** peripherals: SIXAXIS, DualShock, and Navigation controllers. Many aftermarket and clone devices have appeared over time, aimed at compatibility with the PlayStation 3. Even official Sony hardware can behave differently on other platforms, often due to firmware differences.

Although compatibility with a wide range of devices was a goal, **it is not possible to support every device** at the same level as genuine hardware. Some third-party controllers use chips that react differently to Bluetooth behaviour that cannot always be controlled on Windows; some are timing-sensitive and fail if packets do not match what the PlayStation 3 expects. Some simply do not connect even when other devices work. This is a limitation that is unlikely to change soon.

You are welcome to try BthPS3 with your hardware. Reports that a specific third-party or clone controller "does not work" may be closed without further action—there is no way to fix every manufacturer’s firmware. If you have problematic hardware and are willing to send it for analysis, that can sometimes help. Otherwise, using genuine or well-tested third-party controllers is the most reliable option.
