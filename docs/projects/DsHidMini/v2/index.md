# Major Version 2

!!! warning "DsHidMini v2 is no longer maintained"
    **DsHidMini v2** is no longer maintained. New development and fixes happen in [DsHidMini v3](../v3/index.md). The documentation below is kept for archival purposes and for users who choose to stay on v2.

## Still fine to use

If you are already on v2 and everything works for you, **you can keep using it**. Version 2 is stable and will continue to work on supported Windows versions. You will not receive security or feature updates, and future Windows or hardware changes may eventually cause issues.

## We recommend v3

For new installations and for the best experience going forward, use **[DsHidMini v3](../v3/index.md)** instead. V3 offers:

- Native Xbox One controller emulation and improved compatibility
- Full Windows 11 support with a Microsoft-signed driver
- A new configuration tool (ControlApp) and ongoing development

You can [install v3](../v3/How-to-Install.md) alongside or as a replacement for v2; switching is not a one-way street—you can go back to v2 if needed.
