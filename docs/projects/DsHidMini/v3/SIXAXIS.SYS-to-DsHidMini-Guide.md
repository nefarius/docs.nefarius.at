# Switch from SIXAXIS.SYS to DsHidMini

!!! note "Handled by the installer"
    If the Sony SIXAXIS.SYS driver is present on your system, the DsHidMini setup (MSI installer) takes care of switching to DsHidMini automatically. No manual driver change or removal steps are required—just run the installer and follow the [How to Install](How-to-Install.md) guide.
