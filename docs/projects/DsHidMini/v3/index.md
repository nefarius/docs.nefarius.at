![controlapp-preview-image.jpg](images/controlapp-preview-image.jpg)

## Before proceeding...

- The Beta version of DsHidMini V3 is... well, Beta. This means it's not entirely finished and there may be unresolved issues or features that are not yet implemented
- Before asking questions about what new features are available or which bugs were fixed **check both the [open](https://github.com/nefarius/DsHidMini/milestone/7) and [closed](https://github.com/nefarius/DsHidMini/milestone/7?closed=1) issues and PRs on GitHub** first! We know reading can be tedious, but repeatedly answering the same questions is equally frustrating for us.

## Highlights

The following features are considered done and have been tested to the best of the abilities to a two-head development team 😉

- Native **Xbox One Controller emulation**
    - Test as many modern games in this mode as you like, [feedback welcome](https://github.com/nefarius/DsHidMini/discussions/114)!
- Full Windows 11 compatibility
    - From now on the driver will be signed by Microsoft
- A new configuration tool, which allows you to...:
    - configure LED behavior
    - change/disable the combo used to turn off the controller when wireless
    - adjust the deadzone of the sticks
    - tweak rumble settings
    - etc
- ARM64 builds of the driver
    - ~~Currently **untested**, feedback welcome!~~
    - Appears to work fine on Apple Silicon using Windows 11 on Parallels
- To be filled...
