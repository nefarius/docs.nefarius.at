# Why You Are Seeing This Update

You are seeing this update because a small background component called **Nefarius VirtualPad Driver Runtime** was installed together with an application named [**DSX**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812620/DSX/).

This component provides runtime features that [DSX](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812620/DSX/) needs to work properly. It does **not** collect personal data (PII) or run constantly in the background. It only performs a lightweight periodic check for updates and does **not** affect your computer’s performance.

If you still use [**DSX**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812620/DSX/), you should install this update to keep everything secure, working smoothly, and prepared for upcoming DSX updates and feature additions.

# Don’t Remember Installing DSX?

If you no longer use DSX—or don’t remember ever installing it—that’s completely normal. DSX included the **Nefarius VirtualPad Driver Runtime** automatically, so it may have been added a long time ago.

If you have already uninstalled DSX or simply no longer need it, you can safely remove this runtime component as well.
